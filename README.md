# tidalplant
A short operational model for the simulation of tidal power plants.

The aim of this project is to include short examples for the simulation of tidal range power plants through a 0-D modelling technique. A finite difference approach is used to simulate the project in time.

The formulations and applications of this work have been reported in several studies, beginning with:

The development of the tools has been funded by EPSRC (EP/K503733/1) and NERC (EP/K503733/2) research at the University of Edinburgh and Imperial College London.
